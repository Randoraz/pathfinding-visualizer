## Description

This project is still in development. Currently it uses Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path between the start and end nodes. Then, it animates all nodes checked by the algorithm and shows the shortest path in yellow. The user can change the grid size, the position of the start node and the position of the end node. It's also possible to add walls to the grid, making the algorithm skip those wall nodes. This project was made using React.
